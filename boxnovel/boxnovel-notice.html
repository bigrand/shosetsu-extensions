<h1>NOVEL BROKEN! Please Migrate!</h1>

<h2>Why Am I Seeing This?</h2>
<p>
	A while ago, <strong>Novgo (Boxnovel)</strong> updated their website
	template (and their name: NovLove), which caused the existing extension to
	stop working. As part of the update, they also changed the URLs for novels
	and chapters. Unfortunately, it's not possible for us to automatically
	migrate your saved novels to their new site.
</p>

<h2>What Should I Do?</h2>
<p>
	The good news is that <strong>Novgo (Boxnovel)</strong> has been updated to
	support the new website structure. While we can’t migrate your novels
	automatically, you can continue using the extension by
	<em>manually</em> searching for your novels again after updating or
	reinstalling it.
</p>

<h2>How to Migrate</h2>
<ol>
	<li>
		Update or reinstall the extension.
		<ul>
			<li>
				If you're seeing this message, it means you're already using the
				updated version.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you've updated <strong>Novgo (Boxnovel)</strong> but don't
				see the name change to <strong>NovLove (Boxnovel)</strong>,
				don't worry, it has updated.
			</li>
			<li>
				The name will appear correctly after reinstalling the extension.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Search for your novel manually using the updated extension.</li>
	<li>
		Before migrating, make a note of which chapters you’ve already read to
		mark them as read later.
	</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Happy reading!</strong> ~o~</p>
